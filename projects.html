          This is a simple film finder where you can filter movies based on
          categories and/or search tag. Clicking on a movie will bring you to
          the IMDB page. This was a study assignment in which the goal was to
          add and remove content to the DOM. It is built with HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript. It uses a local file to act as a small database.
