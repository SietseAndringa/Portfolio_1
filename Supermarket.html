          This is an online supermarket where you can order groceries. You can
          view different products and add them to your shopping cart. You can
          then make your payment using the integrated payment system Stripe
          Checkout. This was the final assignment of the React course that I
          followed. It is therefore not a real webshop and is only intended for
          demonstration.
        </p>
        <p>
          This site is built with ReactJS and uses technologies such as JSX,
          Hooks, Context, React Router, APIs and library integration (Stripe
          Checkout)
        </p>
        <p>
          During the course I learned all the necessary concepts step by step,
          which I later applied in the final assignment. It was a fun process to
          integrate all the components and to see the webshop slowly taking
          shape. Some parts were quite difficult to understand, such as JSX,
          props, state and context.
