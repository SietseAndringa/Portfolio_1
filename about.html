      <p>Hi, i'm Sietse Andringa</p>
      <p>
        I grew up on a farm in the north of the Netherlands and ever since I was
        a kid I have been interested in computers and enjoyed the process of
        creating and fixing things. In my spare time I love to work with
        computers. Most of the time I spend on gaming, but I also like to do
        stuff like photo editing, fixing problems for friends and family, or
        just fiddling around and be creative. <br />
        After working as an operator in a factory for more than 15 years, I
        decided it was time for a change and point my arrows towards my passion:
        computers. As a result, I now pursue a career to become a Front-end
        Developer, which combines my interests in computer technology and
        creation. Besides computers I also have a passion for traveling, music,
        movies and cars.
