          This app allows you to track your macronutrients. The total amount per
          nutrient (carbs, protein and fat) is logged and shown in a graph. The
          total amount of calories is also calculated and shown. <br />
          I built this app during a Javascript course and it uses various ES2015
          techniques, such as DOM manipulation, classes, promises, fetching,
          modules, etc. The focus of this project was therefore mainly on the
          functional part and less on the content and styling.

          During the course I learned all the fundamental aspects of Javascript
          and used them to build this app. Building the app step by step was a
          very educational process and it was satisfying to see it becoming more
          and more functional and complete. Some concepts were quite difficult
          to understand, such as classes, asynchronous programming and handling
          (nested) arrays and objects.
